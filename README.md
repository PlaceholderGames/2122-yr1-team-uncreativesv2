## Game Concept
### Game Name
Project: Sumi (Working title)
>[Notes on the name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_calligraphy) (Check the tools section)
### Platform
The game will run on windows x64 based machines, using a keyboard and mouse for inputs. A possible alternative to keybaord and mouse could be using Xinput controllers as Unreal supports those naitively and it shouldn't be too difficult to implement.
### Constraints
While we've now made a game in Unreal, and are on the whole feeling much more confidant that with our first game, We still don't have much experiance in 3D games, pathfidning or using C++ in unreal.
The deadline for this project is January 5th which gives us 7 Weeks to create a playable build.
### Submitter
Team Uncreatives, Consisting of Dylan Rees, Josh Hole, Mateusz Banachowski and Stuart Griffiths.
### Key Target
Project: Sumi (working title) Is a Hack and Slash adventure game where the player draws in their own battlefield through their attacks.
### Brief Description
The game will focus hevily on combat, and keeping combos while the player's attack will create areas of "ink" that will damage enemies and allow the player to use as platforms. This will make the player have to decide what types of attacks they want to use during combat, as large sweeping attacks will leave larger areas where they can no longer stand on. 
### Key Features
The player will have a diverse combo system at their disposal, stringing together different attacks to defeat their enemies.
Attacks will create lines of ink in the air, which the player can use as a platform or wall to gain a tactical advantage over their enemies.
The player will be graded on their preformance in real time, getting feedback on how well they are doing and could be rewarded with stronger attacks.
### Additional Selling Points
The game will have a oriental artstyle focusing on caligraphy during the Tang dynasty.
